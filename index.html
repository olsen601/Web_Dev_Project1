    <h2>Decimal: Base 10</h2><!--to evaluate what a placeholder is and how it's used-->
      <p>
        Let's talk about the decimal number system, you use it every day but have you evaluated how it works?
        Think of the number 100 and what the two zeros represent, they are placeholders. A placeholder is simply a
        digit that is not significant, but even without value it still represents something. In the case of 100,
        the middle zero represents no multiples of ten are present and the last zero means no multiple of one are present.
        Another way to think about it is that the first placeholder reprensents one value between zero and nine and
        every proceeding placeholder is mutiplied by ten. Here is quick example of placeholder values from one
        thousand to one: <br> 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 <br>
      </p>
    <h2>Hexadecimal: Base 16</h2><!--to learn a counting system based on 16-->
      <p>
        Hexadecimal or base 16 works in the same way as the decimal number system but instead of multiplying
        each placeholder by 10 you multiply by 16. A quick example to show the values of placeholders would
        be: <br> 16,536 | 4,096 | 256 | 16 | 1 <br>
        But how can you represent a number past nine, you add A through F to represent 10 through 15.
        So the hexidecimal number system consists of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F and untilizes the placeholder to
        represent higher values just like the decimal number system. When you start counting in hexidecimal and get to
        16 you may ask "how do I represent that value?", well you simply use the second placeholder in the system so
        16 in hexidecimal is 10. (256 | 16 | 0, 0 + 16 + 0) In the previous example you may wonder why zero was used
        in the 256 placeholder value, it was to denote the use of the placholder but just like in the decimal number
        system any zero value proceeding a number with value can be written or simply implied. For example in decimal
        form 1 | 01 | 000001 all represent one, in the form of 1 it's implied that no value is in any
        proceeding placeholder.
      </p>
    <h2>Binary: Base 2</h2><!--to learn a counting system based on 2-->
      <p>
        Binary, base 2 or bin for short is a number system based on the same concepts as decimal and hexidecimal but
        whereas the former and latter multiplies each proceeding placeholder by 10 and 16 respectively binary muliples by 2.
        For example of placeholder values: <br> 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 <br>  Since Binary is limited to either zero or one the
        language can almost be treated as a yes or no question of "does this placeholder have value?" if the answer is yes
        or 1 then you take each vaule of the placeholder and add them together. As an example let's count to eight in bin:
        <br> 0001(one) | 0010(two) | 0011(three) | 0100(four) | 0101(five) | 0110(six) | 0111(seven) | 1000(eight) <br>
      </p>
    <h2>ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange</h2><!--for converting to text-->
      <p>
        ASCII is essentially a code system to represent characters, when you open a text editor like notepad++ or Atom you
        can specify ASCII as the encoding method. The ASCII encoding is necessary for your computer to understand characters
        because it converts characters to numbers which is a format your computer can understand.

        <i>Here you can see that A is represented by 65 in decimal format and 40 in hexadecimal format.</i>
